# Trigger Sequence Pairs  <br>
 ## A simple PL/SQL Code to create a sequence/trigger pair for all the tables of an oracle database.<br><br>
 ### This code generates a trigger/sequence pair for all the database's tables to simulate the identity behavior which does not exist in Oracle DB.<br>
 instead of having to specify a Primary key for each insert statement, this code will just auto fill the primary key value for you.
